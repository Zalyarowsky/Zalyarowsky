I don't fear a man who studied multiple programming languages
I fear a man who mastered only one programming langauge?
```

All i know is GameMaker Language **(GML)**, specifically latest versions **(2.3+)**
Formerly was a **Forts** modder **(Lua)**

No released games, no finished projects but my **magnum opus** is **8BitZ Forts mod**

Actually being pixel artist, coding is about to be my secondary skill so don't expect anything other than a GameMaker game from me</p>

You can contact me only through **Telegram**, almost only messanger i use these days (alternatively you can do it in Discord but i rarely go online there)
